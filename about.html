<section class="about">

    Long URLs are really ugly. And by ugly I mean, REALLY UGLY. <br> On top of it, they are difficult to share and remember. <br> <br> What's the solution? <br><br> Creating a service that returns a shortened URL corresponding a long URL. The short URL,
    when visited must redirect to the the original long URL. <br><br> Kata does exactly the same for you, along with a few really helpful features. <br><br> Without logging in or registering,<br> you can use Kata to generate shortened URLs with a random
    alias, which will be functional 24/7 since the time of generation. <br> <br> But if you register with us, you can <br> <br> - Add a custom alias (OR keep it random) <br> - View all the URLs you shortened till date <br> - View how many times your shortened
    URL has been visited <br> <br> So what are you waiting for? <br> <br>
    <p>Register now on <a class="about-links" href="/register">Kata</a></p> <br> This is just the phase 1 of the project. <br>
    <br> In the future, I have planned to make <br> - A REST API for the backend <br> - A Browser Extension (Chrome, Edge, Firefox & Brave) <br> - A client side rendered web app <br> - A QR Code for urls <br> - Optimizations to the database lookup by
    implementing a bloom filter <br> - Custom Previews <br> - URLs which can expire after certain time <br> - Editble custom <br> <br>
