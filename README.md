# Kata - The Only URL Shortener you need

Welcome to Kata.
Long URLs are really ugly. And by ugly I mean, REALLY UGLY.
On top of it, they are difficult to share and remember. 
What's the solution? 
Creating a service that returns a shortened URL corresponding a long URL.
The short URL, when visited must redirect to the the original long URL.

Kata does exactly the same for you, along with a few really helpful features.

Without logging in or registering,
you can use Kata to generate shortened URLs with a random alias,
which will be functional 24/7 since the time of generation.

But if you register with us, you can
- Add a custom alias (OR keep it random)
- View all the URLs you shortened till date
- View how many times your shortened URL has been visited

So what are you waiting for?
Register on [Kata](https://kata-flask.herokuapp.com/register) now!


This is just the phase 1 of the project.

In the future, I have planned to make
- A REST API for the backend
- A Browser Extension (Chrome, Edge, Firefox & Brave)
- A client side rendered web app
- A QR Code for urls
- Optimizations to the database lookup by implementing a bloom filter
- Custom Previews
- URLs which can expire after certain time
- Editble custom URLs
